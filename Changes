	The MyConText project includes: open, create, drop,
	index_document, find_position, contains and contains_hashref and
	econtains and econtains_hashref. Ale included is MyConText::Web
	(to be probably chenged to generic MyConText::String in the
	future) that provides the indirect mapping of string (as oposed
	to number) names of documents.

	The only supported indexing scheme is list of words and for each
	a blob with docid/count/docid/count/... pairs at the moment.

	Also included is a test_data directory with a snapshot of my
	DBD::XBase project. The tests are rather comprehensive and
	include benchmarks (which means they take a couple of minutes to
	finish, the benchmarks should probably be splitted out from the
	basic tests in the future).
