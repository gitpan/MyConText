This is the to-do list for the XBase and DBD::XBase packages:

Short term (I will do them as my time allows):

	Need to fix handling attributes in DBD ...

	When creating table, have option to specify version.

	Support named placeholders.

	Support permissions setup.

	Add support for MDX, CDX and IDX.

Mid term (would appreciate help or comments):

	Add sorting on more than one field in DBD.

	Add memo position caching.

	Polish error reporting from XBase::Index.

Long term (it really depends on many things, mainly whether other
people will demand the feature, offer help):

	Add index support to DBD::XBase (once we have MDX, probably).

	Add write index support.
